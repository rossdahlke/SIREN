            <h2>Privacy Notice</h2>
            <p>SIREN is a data collection tool developed by Stanford University’s Social Media Lab to support research projects within and outside Stanford University. It allows individuals to participate in research into encrypted messaging applications by donating messages received in encrypted messaging applications, including WhatsApp, Telegram, and Signal for academic studies.</p>

            <h3>Categories of Personal Information we process</h3>
            <p>SIREN processes participants’ messages via encrypted messaging applications (WhatsApp, Telegram, and Signal), including the message's text, images, and metadata. These data are stored in secure databases where they are processed and analyzed with the goal of helping the research team understand information dynamics in these types of applications. Data are anonymized using cutting-edge anonymization techniques to ensure user privacy. </p>
            <p>Under the platform's Terms of Use, users are informed that their data from WhatsApp, Telegram, and Signal (if applicable) are being collected. While we take measures to anonymize the data, we encourage potential participants to consider whether they anticipate receiving sensitive information via these applications (e.g., personal health information) or are at particularly high risk (e.g., dissident of a foreign state) and if they wish to proceed with the project knowing their data are being collected. </p>

            <h3>Marketing and Selling</h3>
            <p>No Personal Information or data collected via SIREN will be used to provide users with marketing or will be sold.</p>

            <h3>Sharing your Personal Information</h3>
            <p>Data may be processed with the help of third-party service providers. We also only use services that are compliant with state/local privacy regulations as well as Stanford's regulations.</p>
            <p>If the research team has an agreement with the user to retrieve, analyze and store the data for research purposes, the research team will ensure that their use of the data is compliant with Stanford IRB as well as Stanford privacy rules.
                </p>

            <h3>Data Store and Retention</h3>
            <p>All data shared with Stanford will be stored in Google Firebase and/or Google BigQuery. This is officially approved by Stanford University to store and process moderate and high risk data. Learn more about Stanford University's policy.</p>
            <p>Users may request deletion of any data collected through SIREN at any time.</p>

            <h3>Contact Information</h3>
            <p>For more information on how we collect and process your Personal Information, or if you have any complaints regarding the processing of your Personal Information by Stanford University via the SIREN application, please contact Stanford University’s Privacy Office at privacy@stanford.edu .</p>
