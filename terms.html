            <h2>Terms of Service</h2>
            <p>These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of the application (“Services), and any information, audio or video, data, text, graphics, or other materials collected through the Services (collectively referred to as “Content”). Your access to and use of the Services are conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. By accessing or using the Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms.</p>

            <h3>1. Basic Terms</h3>

            <p>The Services that Stanford provides are always evolving, and the form and nature of the Services that Stanford provides may change from time to time without prior notice to you. In addition, Stanford may stop (permanently or temporarily) providing the Services (or any features within the Services) to you or to users generally and may not be able to provide you with prior notice. We also retain the right to create limits on use and storage at our sole discretion at any time without prior notice to you.</p>

            <h3>2. Privacy</h3>
            <p>Any information that you provide to Stanford is subject to our Privacy Notice, which governs our collection and use of your information. You understand that through your use of the Services you consent to the collection and use (as set forth in the Privacy Notice) of this information, including the transfer of this information to the United States and/or other countries for storage, processing and use by Stanford. As part of providing you the Services, we may need to provide you with certain communications, such as service announcements and administrative messages. </p>
            <p>You are responsible for your use of the Services, for any Content you provide, and for any consequences thereof. Stanford will not be responsible or liable for any use of your Content by Stanford in accordance with these Terms.

Stanford cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with the above.</p>

            <h3>4. Content on the Services</h3>

Each of the subsections below only applies up to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law. Some jurisdictions do not allow the disclaimer of implied warranties or the limitation of liability in contracts, and as a result the contents of this section may not apply to you. Nothing in this section is intended to limit any rights you may have which may not be lawfully limited.</p>

            <h4>11A. The Services are Available "AS-IS"</h4>

            <p>The Stanford Entities make no warranty and disclaim all responsibility and liability for: (i) the completeness, accuracy, availability, timeliness, security, or reliability of the Services or any Content; (ii) any harm to your computer system, loss of data, or other harm that results from your access to or use of the Services or any Content; (iii) the deletion of, or the failure to store or to transmit, any Content and other communications maintained by the Services; and (iv) whether the Services will meet your requirements or be available on an uninterrupted, secure, or error-free basis. No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained from the Stanford Entities or through the Services, will create any warranty not expressly made herein.</p>

            <h4>11B. Links</h4>
            <p>The Services may contain links to third-party websites or resources. You acknowledge and agree that the Stanford Entities are not responsible or liable for: (i) the availability or accuracy of such websites or resources; or (ii) the content, products, or services on or available from such websites or resources. Links to such websites or resources do not imply any endorsement by the Stanford Entities of such websites or resources or the content, products, or services available from such websites or resources. You acknowledge sole responsibility for and assume all risk arising from your use of any such websites or resources.</p>

            <h4>11C. Limitation of Liability</h4>

            <p>THE LIMITATIONS OF THIS SUBSECTION SHALL APPLY TO ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, STATUTE, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE, AND WHETHER OR NOT THE M-POWERING TEACHERS ENTITIES HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH DAMAGE, AND EVEN IF A REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.</p>

            <h3>12. General Terms</h3>

            <h4>12A. Waiver and Severability</h4>
            <p>The failure of Stanford to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision. In the event that any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, then that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.</p>

            <h4>12B. Controlling Law and Jurisdiction</h4>
            <p>These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to or application of its conflict of law provisions or your state or country of residence. All claims, legal proceedings, or litigation arising in connection with the Services will be brought solely in the federal or state courts located in Alameda County, California, United States, and you consent to the jurisdiction of and venue in such courts and waive any objection as to inconvenient forum.</p>
            <p>If you are a federal, state, or local government entity in the United States using the Services in your official capacity and legally unable to accept the controlling law, jurisdiction, or venue clauses above, then those clauses do not apply to you. For such U.S. federal government entities, these Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the United States of America (without reference to conflict of laws) and, in the absence of federal law and to the extent permitted under federal law, the laws of the State of California (excluding choice of law).</p>

            <h4>12C. Entire Agreement</h4>
            <p>These Terms and our Privacy Notice are the entire and exclusive agreement between Stanford and you regarding the Services (excluding any services for which you have a separate agreement with Stanford that is explicitly in addition or in place of these Terms), and these Terms supersede and replace any prior agreements between Stanford and you regarding the Services. Other than members of the group of companies of which M-Powering Teachers is the parent, no other person or company will be third-party beneficiaries to the Terms.</p>
            <p>We may revise these Terms from time to time, the most current version will always be at https://rossdahlke.github.io/siren.github.io/. If the revision, in our sole discretion, is material we will notify you via email to the address associated with your account. By continuing to access or use the Services after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms.</p>
            <p>These Services are operated and provided by Stanford. If you have any questions about these Terms, please contact us.</p>
