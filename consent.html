            <h2>Research Study Consent Form</h2>

            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>You are invited to participate in a research study on the quality of information in messaging applications. You will be asked to answer a series of survey questions.

Your personally identifying information will not be attached to this collected data. All data analyzed will be de-identified. Upon completion of the study, all collected data will be destroyed (i.e., deleted).</p>

            <h3>Time Involvement</h3>
            <p>Your participation will take approximately 30 minutes via the surveys. We also ask that you keep the application downloaded for at least four weeks. </p>
