            <h2>Welcome to the Stanford Social Media Lab WhatsApp Study</h2>
            <p>Thank you for participating in this research project. This project is studying how people consume news and learn about the world in WhatsApp. In addition to completing survey, you will be asked to download an Android application called "Stanford WhatsApp Study." By downloading this application, you agree to participate in this study, which includes consenting to allow the Stanford University research team to collect the coming messages you receive on WhatsApp. No messages that you send will be collected, only messages that you receive. While we implement enterprise-grade security measures, such as anonymization of the content of messages, for example, removing names, phone numbers, and email, in addition to storing the data in encrypted servers, we cannot fully guarantee all your data's security. Please consider if participating in this study is right for you.</p>
            <p>Before downloading the application, please carefully read the informed consent document and the application's terms of service. If you have any questions about this study, please contact Ross Dahlke, PhD Student, at rdahlke@stanford.edu.</p>
