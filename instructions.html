            <h2>Installation Instructions</h2>

            <p>1. To begin the installation process, get out your Android device in which you receive notifications from personal messaging applications (e.g., Android Messaging, WhatsApp, etc.). Ensure the device is connected to the internet. Open your internet browser. We recommend using Google Chrome and the instructions and images below are primarily for downloading the application via Google Chrome. However, other web browsers should work (if you experience problems at any point in the instructions, we recommend starting from the beginning and using Google Chrome, FireFox, or Samsung Internet). In your web browser on Android device in which you receive notifications from personal messaging applications, navigate to the Stanford WhatsApp Study website at rossdahlke.github.io/siren. This is the official site where you'll find all the necessary information and download the study application. If you have not already, please read the Informed Consent, Terms of Service, Privacy Notice tabs.</p>
            <div style="text-align: center;">
                <img src="siren-instructions-screenshots/01.jpg" alt="Step 1" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto; border: 1px solid #ddd; border-radius: 4px; padding: 5px;">
            </div>


            <p>2. After carefully reading the study information and considering your participation, click on the "Download APK" button highlighted in red at the bottom of the page. An "APK" is a file format for Android applications. This will begin the process of downloading the Stanford WhatsApp Study application to your Android device.</p>
            <div style="text-align: center;">
                <img src="siren-instructions-screenshots/02.jpg" alt="Step 2" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto; border: 1px solid #ddd; border-radius: 4px; padding: 5px;">
            </div>


            <p>3. On the Download APK page, you'll see a password field. Enter the password provided to you by the research team in the survey in this field. This security measure ensures that only authorized participants can access the application. After entering the password, click the "Submit" button to proceed with the download.</p>
            <div style="text-align: center;">
                <img src="siren-instructions-screenshots/03.jpg" alt="Step 3" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto; border: 1px solid #ddd; border-radius: 4px; padding: 5px;">
            </div>


            <p>4. After entering the correct password, you'll see a "Download SIREN APK" button. Click on this button to start the download process. A pop-up window will appear asking if you want to download the file or open it. Select the "Download" option to save the APK file to your device. This step ensures that you have the SIREN application file on your Android device, ready for installation in the next steps. If prompted, selected the folder where you would like to have the app file downloaded to (the default Downloads file is fine). Then, click the Download button again. On some devices, there is a security feature which prevents you from downloading the APK file in this way (for example, some Google Pixel phones). If you encounter this issue, you may need to explicitly allow these types of downloads in your device's settings. Visit your phone's help page for instructions on how to do this (for example, <a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/7391672?hl=en#zippy=%2Cget-apps-from-other-sources">click here for Google Pixel's help page</a>).</p>

            </div>


            <p>5. You may receive a warning that the file may be harmful. This step is a standard Android security feature since you are downloading the application from the research team's website instead of the Google Play Store. To proceed with the installation. Click on the "Download" or "Download anyway" button. On some devices, you may need to "Scan" the file to ensure it is safe to install. If so, click "Scan" and then continue to "Download" the app. If you change your mind during this process, you can select "Cancel" or "Cancel, and don't install" but you will not be participating in the study and will not receive compensation for installing the application.</p>
            <div style="text-align: center;">

            </div>

            <p>9. The installation process for the SIREN app is now underway. You'll see a progress bar indicating the status of the installation. This may take a few moments to complete. Please be patient and allow the installation to finish. Do not navigate away from this screen or turn off your device during this process. If you need to cancel the installation for any reason, you can tap the "Cancel" button, but this will abort the installation and you'll need to start over if you want to participate in the study.</p>
            <div style="text-align: center;">
                <img src="siren-instructions-screenshots/09.jpg" alt="Step 9" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto; border: 1px solid #ddd; border-radius: 4px; padding: 5px;">
            </div>


            <p>10. Once the installation is complete, you'll see a message saying "App installed." Next, click the "Open" button. This button will launch the SIREN app, allowing you to begin the setup process to ensure you device is properly configured to start participating in the study.</p>
            <div style="text-align: center;">

            </div>


            <p>11. Upon opening the Notification Reader app, you'll see a screen requesting you to turn on Notification Access. This is a crucial step for the app to function properly and collect the necessary data for the study. To proceed, tap the "Go to Settings" button highlighted in red at the bottom of the screen. This will take you to your device's settings where you can grant the required permissions for the app to access your notifications.</p>
            <div style="text-align: center;">
                <img src="siren-instructions-screenshots/11.jpg" alt="Step 11" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto; border: 1px solid #ddd; border-radius: 4px; padding: 5px;">
            </div>


            <p>12. In the Notification access settings screen, you'll see a list of apps that can access your notifications. Look for "SIREN" application in this list (highlighted in red). To grant the SIREN app permission to access your notifications, tap on the toggle switch next to "Notification Reader" to turn it on. This step is essential for the app to function properly and collect the necessary data for the Stanford WhatsApp Study.</p>
            <div style="text-align: center;">
                <img src="siren-instructions-screenshots/12.jpg" alt="Step 11" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto; border: 1px solid #ddd; border-radius: 4px; padding: 5px;">
            </div>


            <p>13. After tapping the toggle switch, a permission dialog will appear explaining the capabilities of the Notification Reader app. It informs you that the app will be able to read all your notifications, including personal information such as contact names and message content. In this study, we are primarily collecting and analyzing the notification message content. This level of access is necessary for the SIREN app to collect the required data for participation in this study. Note: in this application we do not have the capability to turn on or off your Do not disturb nor settings related to it. We will not be affecting your Do not disturb settings in any way. To proceed with the study, tap the "Allow" button highlighted in red. Remember, granting this permission is essential for participating in the research project.</p>
            <div style="text-align: center;">
                <img src="siren-instructions-screenshots/13.jpg" alt="Step 13" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto; border: 1px solid #ddd; border-radius: 4px; padding: 5px;">
            </div>


            <p>14. After granting permission, you'll be returned to the Notification access settings screen. You should now see that the toggle switch next to "Notification Reader" is turned on and highlighted in blue (as shown in the red box). This indicates that the SIREN app now has permission to access your notifications. With this step completed, the app is now properly configured to collect data for the study. You can now exit the settings and return to the Notification Reader app to complete the final step of the study setup process and to ensure your compensation for participating in the study.</p>
            <div style="text-align: center;">
                <img src="siren-instructions-screenshots/14.jpg" alt="Step 14" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto; border: 1px solid #ddd; border-radius: 4px; padding: 5px;">
            </div>


            <p>15. After successfully granting notification access, return to the SIREN app. You should now see a unique identifier code displayed on the screen (highlighted in red). Note that your code will differ than the example code displayed below. This code is your "SIREN ID" and is unique to you and your Android device. This identifier is crucial for the research team to link your data to your survey responses while maintaining your anonymity. Please make a note of this code or take a screenshot of this screen. You'll need to provide this code in the survey to confirm your participation and ensure you receive compensation for installing the app. With this step, you have completed the installation and setup process for the SIREN app for the Stanford WhatsApp Study. Please return to the survey, input this code, and complete the survey portion of this study.</p>
